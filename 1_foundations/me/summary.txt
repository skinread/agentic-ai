For 15 years I have built content-rich sites and greenfield applications that required bespoke frontend architecture, accessibility, responsive UI, and composable components.

I love to scale up and build out Design Systems, and design engineering practices. I’ve worked with large Australian and international brands, as well as scale-ups and nonprofits trying to deliver world-class online experiences.

My strong collaborative and cross-functional skillset works great in distributed teams. I'm drawn to projects with impact. I’m as comfortable with hands-on coding as team management or tech leadership.
